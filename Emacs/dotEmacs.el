;; Emacs Notes
;; C-h k <the keybind> to find what a key does
;; C-h b to list all bindings (should've used this more when fighting binds...)
;; C-q = quoted-insert "insert the next character, whatever it is" e.g. useful for inserting a tab
;; describe-char with cursor over character will say where the font face came from (useful for theming)
;; Use ibuffer to select and kill many buffers. kill-some-buffers is also okay
;; Use ediff-revision to easily manipulate working edits
;; Use re-builder to create a regex by seeing the results of it in the current buffer (super awesome)
;; Hit C-f while in ido to disable all completion (for when you're fighting it)
;; Amazing multiline editing: C-f to isearch-forward, then C-a to see all results, then e to edit all lines
;; diff-buffer-with-file to see a diff of current (unsaved) modifications

;; Used to load separate configuration files I've created. Order matters so they're scattered a bit

;; BAD THING
;;
;; This is the worst thing ever. Remap keys so I can use C-c and C-x how I damn well please.
;; Subsequently, read C-u as my C-x and C-y as my C-c (yes, it sucks and is confusing as hell.
;; I blame the developers.

(keyboard-translate ?\C-x ?\C-u)

;; This is a stupid hack around an apparent bug in edebug.
;; If set, don't define C-x anywhere. If C-x is defined then edebug complains about it not being a prefix key
;; You'll need to restart in order for it to work
;; Update: After keyboard-translate, this is no longer an issue. Leaving here in case I go back on keyboard-translate
